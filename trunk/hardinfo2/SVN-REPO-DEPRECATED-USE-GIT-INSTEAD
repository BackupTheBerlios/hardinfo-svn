As of June 25, 2008, the SVN repository is deprecated, and all development
is now being tracked with GIT. Source code can be browsed with github, and
can be cloned using the following command:

    * git clone git://github.com/lpereira/hardinfo.git 

This will create a hardinfo subdirectory. To update the source, issue the
command

    * git pull 

inside this directory. Optionally, a GIT snapshot is also available.
